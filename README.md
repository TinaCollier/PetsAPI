# PetsAPI
Simple Pets API using Swagger

# What Is This?
This is a very simple API that allows a user to `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` Pets. We are currently learning about building RESTful APIs and using Swagger to make those APIs more accessible to users. This small, self-contained application runs on a local port. When the user puts in the HTTP request using the Swagger path, they will have the ability to see the types of request that can be made with the API, CURL commands for those requests, and the JSON format. 

# How To Use It
Type in the url and add the Swagger path at the end of the url. For example, `http://localhost:3000/api-docs/`. This will provide the Swagger interface;

# How This Could Be Useful
I can integrate this with all of my APIs. Not only will it be useful for users, but it's a great way to document and organize my APIs.
